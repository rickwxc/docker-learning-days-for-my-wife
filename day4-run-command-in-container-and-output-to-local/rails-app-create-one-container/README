User docker to start new rails project or load exist project into dev server. 


1. create rails docker image.
sh 0build-for-create.sh

2. use run scripts to decide create new app or start dev sever.
sh run.sh
e.g.
sh run.sh init my_app1
sh run.sh start my_app1

If want to update dockerfile and docker-compose file, please update those to files:
Dockerfile.template
docker-compose.template
The run.sh will generated final conf file based on those two .template files.


And some auto-generate files for docker to use(which I already put into .gitignore)
*.cache
docker-compose.yml
